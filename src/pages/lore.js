            <TextBlock.Text>
              In the beginning, there was nothing… nothing but the silence of an
              infinite darkness. Abruptly, from the depths of such darkness,
              sparked an energy, an energy so violent and so profound, perhaps
              charged by an innate will to be free; to break apart the bounds of
              such chains which had silenced its voice. An energy fueled by
              vigor and rage. An untamed energy. Once broken of its bounds, this
              energy began to flood what became to be known as the comprehensive
              universe. This energy which comprised the universe, however, was
              still untamed. For untold eons, the universe was constantly at
              odds with itself, existing in constant disarray and conflict,
              filled with unfound vitality and existing without purpose.
              Instinctively, the energy began to become attracted to itself,
              perhaps longing for a sense of belonging in its lonely existence.
              So the universe's energy began to manifest, congregating together
              until it had amassed into a single condensed point. It was at this
              point that the universe's energy began to take shape, molding into
              the first being, the “Founding Dragon”.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              When the Founding Dragon came into existence, it had inherited the
              state of disarray and confusion the energy of the universe had
              before it. But unlike the thoughtless energy before it, the
              Founding Dragon found itself an intention… a purpose. It began
              sorting the energy from which it was created, taming the unruly
              power and organizing it into coherent forms of matter. Through
              this process, the Founding Dragon's figure began to take shape—the
              element of fire forming the first being's stomach, the air
              becoming its wings, water its blood, lightning providing it a
              source of energy, nurturing earth embodying in the formation of
              its feet, precious metals forming into bones, darkness forming its
              eyes, and light creating its heart.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              Taming the last of the energy within itself, the Founding Dragon
              found itself at peace. Its newly formed body, created through the
              process of separating the individual elements of energy apart, was
              finally at peace. Finishing the monumental task, the Founding
              Dragon began to rest.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              But rest peacefully, the Founding Dragon could not. For when it
              realized it had completed its purpose, it could not sleep
              peacefully. The Founding Dragon's restlessness tore itself apart,
              ending its existence. But the Founding Dragon's life work was not
              in vain, for the 8 elements the Founding Dragon tirelessly tamed
              had remained. The body of the Founding Dragon decayed, forming the
              world in which we exist. While the Founding Dragon's bones formed
              the core of the world and its mountains, its stomach slipped
              between the bones as they formed the earth, creating magma and
              fire below our surface. Next, the dragon's feet fell, its soles
              trampling the earth, softening it and giving life to plants. Next,
              the Founding Dragon's blood spilled from its body into every
              crevice and crack, forming oceans, lakes, and rivers. The Founding
              Dragon's last act was wrapping its wings around itself, creating
              the atmosphere, and in its dying breath, created the winds which
              blow and feed life. With the Founding Dragon now passed, the dark
              and light within its eyes and heart dissipated into the sky,
              forming the day and night.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              But not all of the Founding Dragon's energy became the earth. In
              its passing, some of the Founding Dragon's energy slipped out of
              its body, remaining separate by element but pure in form. Like the
              untamed energy of the universe before it, the remaining energy of
              the tamed elements condensed into a new race of 8 beings: the
              Elder Dragons. Like nothing before them, the Elders too felt
              lonely in the lands from which they resided and claimed. Thus,
              they too began to create life from the world, shaping their
              surrounding elements to create beings in their image. The first
              children the Elders created were a race of dragons known as the
              Kings. In the creation of the Kings, the Elders noticed the sizes
              of their domains began to diminish from their birth and creation.
              But worrying their King children would feel lonely themselves, the
              Elders decided to continue creating. They built their Kings a new
              race of Warriors to accompany them, to exist as their companions
              and servants.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              Even as the Elders ran out of primordial elemental material to
              create more dragons, the Elders continued creating, designing new
              life forms out of their elemental substance. It was only until
              these races and dragons came into contact with beings born from
              other elements that they began to conceptualize the faction from
              which they belonged. Thus, this is how our world came to be…
            </TextBlock.Text>
          </TextBlock>
          <TextBlock textAlign="center">
            <TextBlock.Heading>Chapter 1: Beginning</TextBlock.Heading>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              As tumultuous as the spark of life and the birth of the world was,
              the genesis of sentience was no less turbulent and confusing.
              Sprung out from the very elements of the world itself, the dragons
              wildly sought to find their place. Some sought isolation as an
              alleviating means; lurking in dark caves, sleeping on piles of
              treasure, or basking in the heat of active volcanos. Watching the
              sun set in solitude, they've chosen to wait to see what future
              days bring. Others have sought comfort in finding a
              community—finding companionship with those birthed from the same
              elemental forces.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              As streams and rivers always find their way towards larger bodies
              of water, those birthed from the dew naturally pooled together.
              With a strong and engaged Elder leading their Kings and Warriors
              through the currents, the Water Faction emerged from 'The
              Parturition' as the most organized faction. With strong leadership
              and robust individual members, the <b>Water Faction</b> will most
              certainly be a formidable force in the future.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              In terms of raw strength, following closely behind the Water
              Faction are the <b>Cyborgs</b>. With a mighty elder and engaged
              community, the Cyborg Faction immediately thrived. Hungry for
              information, the Cyborgs jointly cached their power, working
              together to collect data to stave off their eager minds. Coming up
              with new innovative ways to work together, the Cyborg Faction has
              so far thrived off their intelligence and the leadership of their
              powerful Elder.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              But in a troubling development, the Cyborg Elder made a bold move.
              Through the study of the elements and coming to understand the
              laws of nature, Cyborg Dragons learned of the importance of heat
              in the manufacture of precious metals. Seeking to cement the power
              of their faction, the Cyborg Elder made a preemptive strike,
              imposing its will on the Fire Elder and taking control of its
              being.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              The <b>Fire Faction</b> surfaced from 'The Parturition' as one of
              the weaker elemental groups. With an average Elder before the
              Cyborg take over, faction members have not been very engaged,
              preferring to act on their own accord rather than as a group.
              Fixated on growing their own strength and a bit self-serving in
              nature, Fire Dragons have garnered the stereotype of lacking a
              desire to cooperate as a team.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              It has yet to be foreseen whether the Cyborg Elder will choose to
              work with the Fire Elder to strengthen the bonds between their two
              factions, or if the Cyborg Elder took over the Fire Elder in an
              attempt to control the Fire Faction for its own faction's
              nefarious means. But while this development and the faction's lack
              of community effort have caused others to deem the Fire Faction as
              being 'weak', their strength should not be dismissed.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              For all it takes to burn down a dry forest is a single spark.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              Another faction facing troubles with cooperation is the{" "}
              <b>Dark Faction</b>. Self-obsessed in nature and egotistically
              believing their faction to be the best, the Dark Dragons have not
              worked on much community building. Despite this decision putting
              their faction on the bottom of 'the leaderboard', Dark Dragons
              continue to deem teamwork as being unnecessary. While certainly
              handicapped by their own ignorance, independence is not a weak
              trait, but it may become detrimental without moderation.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              While lagging behind the others, the Dark Faction has recently
              begun to stir—with their quiet Elder beginning its effort in
              rallying the faction's Kings and Warriors. In the grand scope, the
              Dark Faction's power is not too far off from the others. Who knows
              what level of strength the Dark Dragons can reach once they
              finally accumulate their community's power…
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              The Earth Faction cropped up as one of the weaker factions with
              average leadership. Despite this, the Earth Dragons set off to
              work, toiling the soil and investing in the ground they shared.
              While the benefits of their labor weren’t immediate, they
              eventually paid off as the faction steadily gained strength.
              Well-knowledged in the working of the universe and with a great
              sense of wisdom, the Earth Dragons today now stand among the top 3
              most powerful factions.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              Opposite of their hard-working, land-dwelling brethren are the{" "}
              <b>Air Dragons</b>. Near the bottom in terms of power, their lack
              of faction strength is not due to a lack of cooperation. On the
              contrary, Air Dragons are some of the most active avian creatures,
              enjoying chatting and playing with each other. And with an Elder
              who spends good effort to bring the Air Faction community
              together, their weak faction strength doesn’t stem from a lack of
              community values. Rather, Air Dragons sometimes find themselves
              too distracted playing in the wind like the free spirits they are.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              The <b>Celestial Faction</b> is a strong unit who have thrived in
              their efforts in faction-building as a team. A large problem
              Celestial Dragons currently face is the absence of their Elder.
              But the gap left open by their unengaged Elder has given many
              Celestial Kings and Warriors the chance to shine bright and take
              leadership into their own hands. With a more decentralized
              leadership, the Celestial Faction has shown off the most dazzling
              community as of yet.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              Much like the Celestials, the <b>Lightning Faction</b> has also
              formed an amazing community off great teamwork. But what gives the
              Lightning Faction an edge over their Celestial brethren is their
              resourceful Elder, who is very active in the community and has
              pooled together many resources for its faction to utilize. With an
              instilled sense of community, a strong willingness to work
              together, and great leadership, Lightning Dragons have an
              energetic future to look forward to.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              Although some factions have become clear ‘front runners of the
              pack’ through stellar leadership and organization, the overall
              difference in power between factions is not all that great. The
              majority of dragons have elected to join their elemental faction,
              with some dragons being more social than others and some dragons
              preferring to keep to themselves. The Parturition was a tumultuous
              and confusing time, but as the creatures of this new world began
              to find their place and realize their purpose, they could only
              theorize the scope of their limitations.
            </TextBlock.Text>
            <TextBlock.Text>
              But not all dragons have found themselves a home. Of the 888
              dragons born to this world, about 40 dragons have not settled
              down. They continue to roam the world as nomads; traveling vast
              distances, exploring the world for its wonders, and never staying
              in one place for too long. Exactly when these dragons will settle
              down and join their elemental factions (if they ever will) has yet
              to be foreseen. But until then, this closes the first page of
              history.
